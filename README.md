## **Synopsis**
The contribution workflow within Django currently involves several manual processes that are error-prone and time-consuming for contributors. This project aims to automate key parts of the workflow, such as:

- **Automating releases** to streamline the deployment process.
- **Identifying active pull requests (PRs)** to improve collaboration and efficiency.
- **Managing aging PR queues** to prevent outdated contributions from being lost.

By implementing GitHub Actions and other automation tools, this project will significantly enhance the Django contribution process, reducing manual workload and improving workflow efficiency.

---

## **Benefits to the Community**
Automating these processes will:
- **Increase efficiency** by reducing manual intervention in routine tasks.
- **Minimize errors** in repetitive processes such as release management.
- **Improve contributor experience** by ensuring PRs are handled in a timely manner.
- **Strengthen the Django ecosystem** by keeping contributions active and organized.

---

## **Deliverables**
By the end of this project, I will deliver:
- **GitHub Actions workflows** to automate tasks such as PR triaging and release management.
- **Scripting solutions** for process automation within Django's contribution workflow.
- **Comprehensive documentation** on the automated workflows and how to maintain them.
- **One or more pull requests (PRs)** implementing these automation features.

---

## **Technical Approach**
### **1. Research and Planning**
- Engage with Django Fellows and the community to determine the most critical tasks for automation.
- Review existing workflows and Djangoâ€™s CI/CD pipeline.

### **2. Implementation**
- Develop **GitHub Actions** workflows to automate:
  - PR review notifications using **scheduled workflows**:
    ```yaml
    name: PR Review Reminder
    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Runs every Monday at 9 AM UTC
    jobs:
      notify_reviewers:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Fetch PRs Awaiting Review
            uses: actions/github-script@v6
            with:
              script: |
                const prs = await github.rest.pulls.list({ owner: 'django', repo: 'django', state: 'open' });
                console.log(prs.data.map(pr => `PR #${pr.number}: ${pr.title}`).join('\n'));
    ```
  - Aging PR management (e.g., reminders, auto-closing stale PRs) using **GitHub Actions stale bot**.
  - Release automation with **GitHub Actions & GitHub API**:
    ```yaml
    name: Django Release Automation
    on:
      push:
        tags:
          - "v*.*.*"
    jobs:
      release:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Create GitHub Release
            uses: actions/create-release@v1
            with:
              tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
              release_name: "Django Release ${{ github.ref }}"
              body: "Automated release generated by GitHub Actions."
    ```

- Create **scripts** to assist with automation, using **Python and shell scripting**:
  - Example: **A script to fetch unreviewed PRs in Djangoâ€™s repository**
    ```python
    import requests
    GITHUB_API = "https://api.github.com/repos/django/django/pulls"
    response = requests.get(GITHUB_API, params={"state": "open"})
    prs = response.json()
    unreviewed_prs = [pr for pr in prs if not pr.get("requested_reviewers")]
    print("Unreviewed PRs:", unreviewed_prs)
    ```

- Integrate **Jenkins** where applicable for build and test automation.

### **3. Testing and Optimization**
- Implement **unit tests and integration tests** for the automation scripts.
- Ensure workflows run efficiently without unintended disruptions.

### **4. Documentation and Finalization**
- Write detailed documentation explaining the automation processes.
- Submit PRs for review and incorporate feedback from the Django community.
