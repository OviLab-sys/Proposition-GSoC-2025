## **Synopsis**
The contribution workflow within Django currently involves several manual processes that are error-prone and time-consuming for contributors. This project aims to automate key parts of the workflow, such as:

- **Automating releases** to streamline the deployment process.
- **Identifying active pull requests (PRs)** to improve collaboration and efficiency.
- **Managing aging PR queues** to prevent outdated contributions from being lost.

By implementing GitHub Actions and other automation tools, this project will significantly enhance the Django contribution process, reducing manual workload and improving workflow efficiency.

---

## **Benefits to the Community**
Automating these processes will:
- **Increase efficiency** by reducing manual intervention in routine tasks.
- **Minimize errors** in repetitive processes such as release management.
- **Improve contributor experience** by ensuring PRs are handled in a timely manner.
- **Strengthen the Django ecosystem** by keeping contributions active and organized.

---

## **Deliverables**
By the end of this project, I will deliver:
- **GitHub Actions workflows** to automate tasks such as PR triaging and release management.
- **Scripting solutions** for process automation within Django's contribution workflow.
- **Comprehensive documentation** on the automated workflows and how to maintain them.
- **One or more pull requests (PRs)** implementing these automation features.

---

## **Technical Approach**
### **1. Research and Planning**
- Engage with Django Fellows and the community to determine the most critical tasks for automation.
- Review existing workflows and Djangoâ€™s CI/CD pipeline.

### **2. Implementation**
- Develop **GitHub Actions** workflows to automate:
  - PR review notifications
  - Aging PR management (e.g., reminders, auto-closing stale PRs)
  - Release automation
- Create **scripts** to assist with automation, using **Python and shell scripting**.
- Integrate **Jenkins** where applicable for build and test automation.

### **3. Testing and Optimization**
- Implement **unit tests and integration tests** for the automation scripts.
- Ensure workflows run efficiently without unintended disruptions.

### **4. Documentation and Finalization**
- Write detailed documentation explaining the automation processes.
- Submit PRs for review and incorporate feedback from the Django community.
